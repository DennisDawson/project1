git init new repository
git add File
git commit -m message

You can explicitly set what will be in the next commit.

My question:

Best practices for multiple changes to the same file in different branches. (e.g., Table of Contents). Review doesn't keep up with the changes I want to make in the docs. The documentation is expected to be ready to publish at any time.
